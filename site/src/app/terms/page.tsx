          Provider: <strong className="text-fg">Flutterando Desenvolvimento de Programas de Computador LTDA</strong>{" "}

        <p>
          By accessing or using the Remote Pi browser PWA, the Remote Pi
          Pi-side extension, the Remote Pi relay service, or any
          other software or service provided under the Remote Pi name
          (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;), you agree to be bound by
          these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;). If you do not agree to
          these Terms, you must not use the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms form a binding agreement between you and Flutterando
          Desenvolvimento de Programas de Computador LTDA (&quot;Flutterando&quot;,
          &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;).
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="account-pairing" number={2} title="Account & Pairing">
        <p>
          Remote Pi does not require you to create an account, register an email
          address, or provide personally identifiable information to use the
          Service. Instead, the Service uses an ephemeral, on-demand pairing
          flow: a QR code generated locally on the Pi-side extension is scanned
          by the Remote Pi browser PWA, establishing a mutually authenticated
          channel between the two peers (Ed25519 challenge-response). See the
          Privacy Policy, section 9, for the full trust model — application-
          layer end-to-end encryption of payloads is on the roadmap, not yet
          active.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each pairing produces a cryptographic key pair stored locally in the
          browser profile and on the Pi. Pairings can be revoked at any time
          from either side. You are responsible for keeping your browser profile
          and machine secure; anyone
          with physical or remote access to a paired device can use that
          pairing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service is not directed at, and may not be used by, individuals
          under 13 years of age.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="features" number={3} title="Features">
        <p>The Service currently provides the following features:</p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2">
          <li>
            Remote control of a Pi-based coding agent (such as Claude Code,
            Codex, or similar) from the paired browser PWA.
          </li>
          <li>
            A local multi-agent messaging mesh on the Pi (UDS broker) that lets
            multiple agents exchange messages while the browser PWA controls
            their paired Pi sessions.
          </li>
          <li>
            An optional public relay service that forwards messages between the
            paired browser PWA and Pi when they are not on the same local network.
            You may instead self-host your own relay using the open-source
            relay code.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Features may be added, modified, or removed at any time. We will make
          a reasonable effort to communicate breaking changes through the
          project README and this site.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="user-content" number={4} title="User-Generated Content">
        <p>
          The prompts you send to your Pi-side agent and the responses produced
          by that agent (&quot;User Content&quot;) belong to you. Flutterando
          does not log, persist, or inspect User Content.
        </p>
        <p>
          For full transparency about the current trust model: in the current
          MVP, message payloads travel base64-encoded over TLS between your
          devices and the relay. Application-layer end-to-end encryption is{" "}
          <strong className="text-fg">not</strong> active yet (it was removed
          for MVP stability and is on the roadmap). This means the operator of
          the relay you connect to could in principle access plaintext message
          contents while forwarding them. Users who require cryptographic
          confidentiality from the relay operator should self-host the relay
          (it is open source and the docs cover Docker + VPN deployment). See
          our Privacy Policy, section 9, for the full description.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for the User Content you send through the
          Service and for ensuring that you have the right to send and receive
          that content under applicable law and any third-party agreements
          (including the terms of any AI provider whose model the Pi-side agent
          uses).

      <LegalSection id="prohibited" number={5} title="Prohibited Conduct">
        <p>You must not:</p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2">
          <li>
            Attempt to break, bypass, or weaken the cryptographic
            authentication used by the Service (Ed25519 pairing, TLS to the
            relay), or attempt to impersonate another paired device.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attack, overload, or otherwise disrupt the relay infrastructure or
            any other component of the Service (denial-of-service, abusive
            connection patterns, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            Reverse-engineer the Service for the purpose of producing a
            confusingly similar product or circumventing security features
            (reverse engineering for interoperability or security research is
            permitted to the extent allowed by applicable law).
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the Service to commit, facilitate, or attempt unlawful acts, or
            to violate the rights of any third party.

        <p>
          Remote Pi does not host or moderate user-to-user content (the relay is
          oblivious to message contents), so there is no general content
          moderation process. However, if you discover a security vulnerability
          in the Service or believe the Service is being abused to attack
          infrastructure or users, please report the issue to{" "}

          The Service is provided on an &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as
          available&quot; basis. We do not guarantee that the Service will be
          uninterrupted, error-free, or free from defects, and we may suspend,
          modify, or discontinue all or part of the Service at any time without
          prior notice.

        <p>
          The public relay in particular is a free, best-effort service. If you
          require strong availability guarantees, you should self-host the
          relay.

      <LegalSection id="liability" number={9} title="Liability Limitation">
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Flutterando shall
          not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
          punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, use,
          goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your use of
          or inability to use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any
          third party in the Service; (iii) any unauthorized access to, use of,
          or alteration of your transmissions or content; or (iv) any other
          matter relating to the Service.

          always published on this site, with the &quot;Last updated&quot; date
          at the top. Material changes will additionally be announced in the
          project README. Your continued use of the Service after a change
          becomes effective constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.

            /remote-pi revoke &lt;id&gt;

          . You may also clear Remote Pi&apos;s browser site data and stop or
          uninstall the Pi-side extension to fully stop using the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access to the public relay if you
          violate these Terms or if your usage threatens the stability or
          security of the Service.
