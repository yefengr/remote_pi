              remote-pi makes a different bet. It starts from Pi — a lightweight
              coding agent — and adds just the always-on layer: a supervisor
              that keeps it running and a browser PWA that drives it. Everything else,
              you assemble. The trade is real: less out of the box, more
              that&apos;s exactly yours.

              Want a complete, all-in-one platform, ready out of the box?
              OpenClaw and Hermes Agent are great places to start. Want a
              lightweight coding agent you assemble, keep alive 24/7, and
              control from a browser PWA? That&apos;s Pi with remote-pi.

              One note on scope: this comparison is about the{" "}
              <em>always-on layer</em> — remote-pi&apos;s daemon mode — not
              coding agents in general. It&apos;s the part where keeping an agent
              alive and reachable is the whole job, and where OpenClaw and Hermes
              Agent shine too.
