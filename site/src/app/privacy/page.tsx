          2.1 Data you provide directly
        </h3>
        <p>
          Remote Pi is designed so that you provide essentially nothing to us on
          the relay path. There is no account, no email registration, no
          profile, and no payment information. The pairing flow generates
          cryptographic keys locally on your devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the browser PWA, IndexedDB stores your local Remote Pi identity,
          paired peers (their public keys, a friendly name you choose, and the
          relay URL), session history, and messages in this browser profile.
          Private keys remain in the browser profile and are never sent to the
          relay.

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-fg">
          2.2 Data processed automatically by the public relay
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you connect to the public relay operated by Flutterando, the
          relay processes three categories of data:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong className="text-fg">Connection metadata</strong> — source
            IP address, connection timestamps, public-key identifier of the
            connecting peer, room identifiers, and basic transport statistics
            (bytes in/out, message timing and sizes). This is{" "}
            <strong className="text-fg">logged</strong> for at most 30 days and
            used for abuse mitigation and reliable operation of the relay.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-fg">Message payloads</strong> forwarded
            between paired peers. In the current MVP, payloads travel
            base64-encoded over TLS and{" "}
            <strong className="text-fg">
              are not end-to-end encrypted at the application layer
            </strong>
            . The relay operator could in principle access plaintext message
            contents in memory while forwarding. We do{" "}
            <strong className="text-fg">not log, persist, or inspect</strong>{" "}
            those payloads — we forward them and discard them. See §9 for the
            full trust model.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-fg">Signed mesh-membership blobs.</strong>{" "}
            When you pair a new machine, your Owner key signs a small JSON
            blob listing which Pi devices belong to that Owner&apos;s mesh,
            and your app uploads it to the relay via{" "}
            <code className="rounded bg-surface px-1 py-0.5 font-mono text-xs text-fg">
              POST /mesh/&lt;owner_pk_hash&gt;
            </code>
            . The relay verifies the Ed25519 signature and persists the blob
            (a few KB per Owner) so that new devices restoring the same Owner
            key can recover their peer list. The blob contains: Owner public
            key, a version number, the list of Pi public keys you have
            paired, and a timestamp. It is{" "}
            <strong className="text-fg">not encrypted</strong> — anyone with
            access to the relay database can read it. Pairing on your own
            self-hosted relay keeps this data on your infrastructure.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you require cryptographic confidentiality from the relay operator,
          self-host the relay (the code is open source and documented). When
          you self-host, the data described in §2.2 is processed by your own
          infrastructure, not by Flutterando.

          <li>Background microphone or camera access. The browser requests camera access only when you scan a pairing QR or explicitly attach an image.</li>

        <p>
          Under the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção
          de Dados, Law 13.709/2018, &quot;LGPD&quot;), we process the limited
          data described above on the following legal bases:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2">
          <li>

      <LegalSection id="sharing" number={5} title="Data Sharing">
        <p>
          We do not sell or rent your data. We do not share connection metadata
          with third parties for advertising or analytics purposes. We may
          disclose data only when required to do so by a valid legal order
          under Brazilian law, and only to the extent strictly necessary to
          comply with that order.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to self-host your own relay or connect to a relay
          operated by a third party, that operator becomes the data controller
          for the connection metadata they process. This Policy does not cover
          third-party relays.

      >
        <p>
          The public relay operated by Flutterando may be hosted in data centers
          located outside Brazil. Where this is the case, transfers occur under
          conditions equivalent to those required by Article 33 of the LGPD,
          including contractual safeguards with infrastructure providers. You
          can avoid international transfer entirely by running your own relay
          on infrastructure under your control.

        <p>
          Relay connection logs are retained for a maximum of{" "}

          deleted or anonymized. Aggregated, non-identifying statistics (e.g.
          daily active connection counts) may be retained longer for capacity
          planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paired peers and session data stored in the browser persist until you
          revoke the pairing or clear Remote Pi&apos;s site data. We do not have
